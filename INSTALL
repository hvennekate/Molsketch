Short instructions for building the source with CMake:
0. Prepare
- Unpack the source and change to the source dir
- mkdir build
- cd build

1. Building
- cmake ..
(occasionally, you may have to use
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
instead)
- make
1.1 Install the binary (if desired)
- make install
1.2 Make a package (if desired)
- make package

2. Notes on OpenBabel (esp. Windows)
If you have difficulties making qmake or cmake find openbabel, you might want to set the variables OB_LIBRARY_DIRS and OB_INCLUDE_DIRS:
cmake -DOB_LIBRARY_DIRS=<path of openbabel.dll/libopenbabel.so> -DOB_INCLUDE_DIRS=<directory containing babelconfig.h> <path to Molsketch sources>
or
qmake OB_LIBRARY_DIRS=<openbabel.dll/libopenbabel.so directory> OB_INCLUDE_DIRS=<directory containing babelconfig.h> <path to Molsketch sources>
